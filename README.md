## Description

The Code Quiz Game is an interactive quiz application designed to test your knowledge of programming and coding concepts. It challenges your problem-solving skills while also testing your ability to answer questions under time constraints. The game is fun, educational, and can be used as a learning tool or a competitive quiz.

## Features:

### Start Button:
 Begin the game by clicking the "Start" button. As soon as you start, a timer begins counting down, and you are presented with your first question.

### Question Presentation:
 Each question is displayed on the screen, along with multiple-choice answers. Read the question carefully and select your answer from the available options.

### Answer Validation:
 When you submit an answer, the application will validate it. If you answer correctly, you move on to the next question. If you answer incorrectly, a penalty in the form of time deduction will be applied.

### Time Management: 
The timer is crucial. If you run out of time before answering all the questions, the game ends. Correctly answered questions will also contribute to your final score.

### Game Over:
 The game is over when you have answered all the questions or when the timer reaches zero. Your score will be calculated based on the number of correct answers and the time remaining on the timer.

### High Score: 
After the game ends, you have the option to save your initials and your score. This information will be recorded and can be used to compete with others or track your progress.
